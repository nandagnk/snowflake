Zero copy clone
===============

Zero-Copy Clones 

Zero-copy clones can serve as a quick backup by taking a snapshot of the database(metadata, permissions, and DDLs) at a given point in time, 
but will not copy the real data. It captures a snapshot of data present in the source object when a clone is created and is made available to 
the cloned object. Every time there is an update to the original database, the cloned database needs to be recreated, i.e., when you alter a 
table in the original database, the cloned database still retains the DDL before the change.
