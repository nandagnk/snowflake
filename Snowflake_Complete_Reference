Reference : https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-key-concepts

1. Cloud Services Layer
2. Query Proecessing Layer
3. Data Storage Layer - Hybird Columnar Storage - Compressed and saved as blobs in Cloud storage.

1. Cloud Services Layer
=======================
Authentication, Access Control
Security
Infrastructure manager  -- creation of warehouse,users, roles, any objects - no need of warehouse to perform these operations, managed internally.
Matadata manager - Metadata management 
Query Optimizer - Query Optimization
Query Planning
Refered as brain of the snowflake system

2. Query Processing Layer - Alternatively referred as compute layer, Compute Notes, Virtual warehouse, cloud computing
=========================
perform actual query processing.
Data Loading, Unloading, Data Processing, DML etc.
Performs MMP (Masive parallel processing)
Refered as muscle of the snowflake system.

3. Data Storage Layer
======================
Data is stored in Hybird Columnar Storage (data is stored in columns) - Compressed and saved as blobs in Cloud storage. More efficient in storing and 
performing analytical data processing.

Warehouse Sizes (Billed per seconds, minimum 60 seconds)

XSmall 					Consists 1 server 				- consumes 1 Credit for 1 hour
Small					consists 2 servers				- consumes 2 Credits for 1 hour
Medium					consists 4 servers				- consumes 4 Credits for 1 hour
Large					consists 8 servers				- consumes 8 Credits for 1 hour
XLarge					consists 16 servers				- consumes 16 Credits for 1 hour
2XLarge					consists 32 servers				- consumes 32 Credits for 1 hour
3XLarge					consists 64 servers				- consumes 64 Credits for 1 hour
4XLarge					consists 128 servers			- consumes 128 Credits for 1 hour
5XLarge					consists 256 servers			- consumes 256 Credits for 1 hour

Setting up a warehouse
======================

1. using interface
2. using sql command

Reference: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses

AccountAdmin or Security Admin can view the existing warehouses.
Only AccountAdmin and Sysadmin or other custom roles as accountadmin/sysadmin access only can create a new warehouse.

Types - Standard / Snowpark-Optimized
Standard - used for most workloads including snowpark. 
Snowpark-Optimized - offers a larger memory and cache. They are often used for memory intensive operations. Machine Learning an example.

Multicluster warehouse is a group of warehouses of the samesize, multicluster will have the minimum and maximum number of clusters defined.
Minimum - is when the load is less or normal
and maximum will get scaled out when the load increases 
Multiclustering is to support concurrent processing of queries.

Multicluster scalling policy  - Standard or Economy 
Standard(default) will spin-up the additional cluster once the active clusters are busy and there is a demand. This prevents/minimizes the queuing of workloads. And
shutdown the cluster after 2 to 3 consecutive successful checks(performed 1 minute interval) resulting the load is less and cluster is inactive.
Economy : Conserves credits by keeping the running clusters fully loaded than starting additional node. This may result in queries being queued and taking longer 
to complete. This will spin-up the additional cluster when there is a demand to keep the server busy for atleast 6 minutes and shutdown the node after 5 to 6 consecutive 
successful checks resulting the load is less and cluster is inactive. 

When to go for multicluster?
1. when Number of users increses in the system.
2. when number of queries/workloads increases to get waiting in the queue.

Query Acceleration
Accelerate outlier queries with additional flexible compute resources. 
Learn more - https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/query-acceleration-service

How to size the warehouse?
The best pracise is to start with XtraSmall and run various queries/load and determine the correct size.

Other best pracises in setting up a warehouse.
Setup the Autoresume parameter true and define the time limit for the parameter Autosuspend (default 10 minutes )


Setting up a warehouse using sql command

use role accountadmin; or 
use role sysadmin;

create or replace warehouse <warehouse_name>
with
warehouse_size = 'xsmall'
min_cluster_count = 1
max_cluster_count = 3
auto_resume = True
comment = ''

example

create or replace warehouse Finanace_wh
with
warehouse_size = 'xsmall'
min_cluster_count = 1
max_cluster_count = 3
auto_resume = True
initially_suspended = true
comment = 'This warehouse used by finanace team for various workloads related to finance.';

Warehouse FINANACE_WH successfully created.

Loading Data
============
Types of loading

a. Bulk loading
	Most frequent method
	Uses warehouses
	Loading from stages
	COPY command
	Transformations possible 	

b. Continuous loading
	Designed to load small volumes of data
	Automatically once they are added to stages
	Lates results for analysis
	Snowpipe (Serverless feature)

Types of Stages
a. Internal stages (Local storage provided by Snowflake)
	Named Stages
	User Stages
	Table Stages

External Stages
	External storages (GCP, Azure Blob storge or Amazson S3)
	Requires a data integration object (for secured data loading)
	Requires a Stage URLs

Creating an external stage
==========================

use role sysadmin;

CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE MANAGE_DB;

CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA external_stages;

// Publicly accessible staging area 
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage
    url='s3://bucketsnowflakes3';

SQL Error [100080] [22000]: Number of columns in file (2) does not match that of the corresponding table (6), 
    use file format option error_on_column_count_mismatch=false to ignore this error
  File 'sampledata.csv', line 3, character 1
  Row 1 starts at line 2, column "ORDERS"["AMOUNT":2]
  If you would like to continue loading when an error is encountered, use other values such as 'SKIP_FILE' 
  or 'CONTINUE' for the ON_ERROR option. For more information on loading options, please run 'info loading_data' in a SQL client.
  
now load the specific file "OrderDetails.csv", we can specifiy multiple files also in a comma separated list
  
COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS
    FROM @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    files = ('OrderDetails.csv');
    
select count(1) from OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS;

COUNT(1)|
--------+
    1500|

Run the copy command once again and check the count, there won't be any change. 
Since the file "OrderDetails.csv" is already loaded snowflake will not process the file again.

now truncate the table again and reload the same file using patter keyword, when the table is truncated, previous load related metadata is removed as a result 
snowflake allow to load the data from the same file again.

truncate table OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS;

COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS
    FROM @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)

How to query the data directly from the external stage files without loading to tables? or before loading to tables?

step 1 - create a file format
step 2 - query the data using the fileformat.

CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT my_csv_format_1
TYPE = 'csv' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' skip_header = 1;

select
	$1::string AS orderid,
	$2::int AS amount,
	$3::int AS profit,

	$5::STRING AS category ,
	$6::STRING AS subcategory
from @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage 
(file_format => my_csv_format_1, pattern=>'.*Order.*')

Continue Vs SKIP_FILE
Continue will ignore the invalid records and proceed with remaining rows.
Skip_file will ignore the entire file when a invalid record found.

SKIP_FILE_<number>
==================
This options allow us to define the maximum allowed invalid records for a file, records will get ignored and will get loaded until it reaches the allowed limit, 
once the error record count reached the maximum error specified, then it will ignore the entire file.

TRUNCATE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS_EX;    

// Error handling using the ON_ERROR option = SKIP_FILE_<number>
COPY INTO OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS_EX
    FROM @MANAGE_DB.external_stages.aws_stage_errorex
    file_format= (type = csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1)
    files = ('OrderDetails_error.csv','OrderDetails_error2.csv')
    ON_ERROR = 'SKIP_FILE_2';

s3://bucketsnowflakes4/OrderDetails_error.csv	LOAD_FAILED	1500		0			2			2			Numeric value 'one thousand' is not recognized	2	14	"ORDERS_EX"["PROFIT":3]

in the above example the maximum error limit is 2 once the limit is reached, system will ignore the file.

in the above example the maximum error limit is 3 but the no of errors in the file is 2 so, it ignored the errored records and processed the remaining records

This option will allow us to define the allowable error records in percentage, the functionality is same as skip_file_number, only difference is it will dynamically
find the number of records can be igmored for each file on the fly based on the total number of records by applying the % on the total record count.

SIZE_LIMIT
==========

SIZE_LIMIT (> 0) that specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of data to be loaded for a given COPY statement. When the threshold is exceeded, the COPY operation 
discontinues loading files. This option is commonly used to load a common group of files using multiple COPY statements. For each statement, the data load 
continues until the specified SIZE_LIMIT is exceeded, before moving on to the next statement.

For example, suppose a set of files in a stage path were each 10 MB in size. If multiple COPY statements set SIZE_LIMIT to 25000000 (25 MB), each would 
load 3 files. That is, each COPY operation would discontinue after the SIZE_LIMIT threshold was exceeded.

Note that at least one file is loaded regardless of the value specified for SIZE_LIMIT unless there is no file to be loaded.

Review the above properties carefully, while creating the file format nothing was specified except the file format name, hence all the properties are 
populated with default values. 

So, the default file format type is CSV, default field delimiter is ',' and skip_hear is 0.

// Using file format object in Copy command, this will fail to load data as skip header is 0(no header info in the file) it consider the 1 line as data but line 1 contains 
column header and the entire row is string.
